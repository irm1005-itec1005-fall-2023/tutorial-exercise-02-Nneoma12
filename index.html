      <h2 id="form ">Ward Councillor Evaluation Form</h2>
      <p>Rents too high? Not enough housing options in your neighbourhood. OCTranspo buses constantly late or not arriving at all. OTrain shut down again? Do you have to ride your bike on a sidewalk because the roads you use aren't comfortable and don't have a protected bike lane? These are all examples of areas of responsibilities that fall to the city and to the mayor and local councillors. Let your councillor know what you think about the job they are doing. Fill out the form below to provide your feedback.
